The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses. <ul> <li><strong>Considerations for licensors:</strong> Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright. <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors_and_licensees#Considerations_for_licensors">More considerations for licensors</a>.</li> <li><strong>Considerations for the public:</strong> By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor permission is not necessary for any reason for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable. <a href="http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors_and_licensees#Considerations_for_licensees">More considerations for the public</a>.</li> </ul> <h2 id="creativecommonsattributionnoncommercialnoderivatives40internationalpubliclicense"> Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License </h2> By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions. <h3 id="section1definitions"> Section 1 - Definitions. </h3> a. <strong>Adapted Material</strong> means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor.

For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights. e. <strong>Effective Technological Measures</strong> means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements. f. <strong>Exceptions and Limitations</strong> means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material. h. <strong>Licensed Material</strong> means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License. i. <strong>Licensed Rights</strong> means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license. h. <strong>Licensor</strong> means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License. i. <strong>NonCommercial</strong> means not primarily intended for or directed towards commercial advantage or monetary compensation. For purposes of this Public License, the exchange of the Licensed Material for other material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights by digital file-sharing or similar means is NonCommercial provided there is no payment of monetary compensation in connection with the exchange. j. <strong>Share</strong> means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them. k. <strong>Sui Generis Database Rights</strong> means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world. l. <strong>You</strong> means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License.

The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.</li> <li><strong>Downstream recipients.</strong><pre><code>A. __Offer from the Licensor - Licensed Material.__ Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.

	B. __No downstream restrictions.__ You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.

You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights. <h3 id="section5disclaimerofwarrantiesandlimitationofliability"> Section 5 - Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability. </h3> a. <strong>Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other.

Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.</strong> c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability. <h3 id="section6termandtermination"> Section 6 - Term and Termination. </h3> a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically. b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates: <ol> <li>automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or</li> <li>upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.</li> </ol> c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License. d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License. <h3 id="section7othertermsandconditions"> Section 7 - Other Terms and Conditions. </h3> a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed. b.

No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor. d.
