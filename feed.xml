<h1 id="creation-of-a-chatbot-with-an-opensource-model">Creation of a chatbot with an opensource model</h1>

<p>Chatbots are software applications that emerged in the 1960s that simulate having a conversation with a person by providing automatic responses, which are previously established by a set of experts to inputs made by the user. These bot, also known as expert systems, use case-based reasoning (CBR).</p>

<p>Typically, the conversation is text-based, although there are also models with a multimedia user interface that allow for auditory input. More recently, some are starting to use text-to-speech (CTV) software, making the interaction with the user more realistic and helping to reduce response time.</p>

<p>In order to establish a conversation, easily understandable and coherent sentences have to be used, although most conversational bot do not fully understand. Instead, they take into account the speaker’s words or phrases, which will allow them to use a set of pre-prepared responses. They are able to recognise the way in which a sentence is formulated thanks to a series of pre-established comparative patterns, and thus, based on the different variables of that sentence, they present a corresponding response. In this way, the bot is able to follow a conversation with more or less logic, but without really knowing what it is talking about.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation-rag">¿What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?</h1>

<p>It is the knowledge augmentation that is applied to a data-driven LLM that has not been trained. This allows the generative AI system to provide contextually appropriate answers to queries, as well as to base those answers on extremely recent data.</p>

<p>In short, RAG helps LLMs to provide more suitable answers.</p>

<p><strong>Key findings</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>RAG is a relatively new artificial intelligence technique that improves the quality of generative AI by allowing large language models (LLMs) to leverage additional data resources without the need for retraining</li>
  <li>RAG models create repositories of knowledge based on the organisation’s own data. These repositories can be continuously updated to help generative AI provide context-aware and timely responses</li>
  <li>Chatbots and other conversational systems that use natural language processing can benefit greatly from RAG and generative AI</li>
  <li>Implementing RAG requires technologies such as vector databases, which enable rapid encoding of new data and searching on that data to feed the LLM</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2>

<p>The data from this knowledge library is processed into numerical representations using a special type of algorithm called an embedded language model and stored in a vector database, which can be quickly searched to retrieve the correct contextual information.</p>

<h1 id="architecture">Architecture</h1>

<p><img src="/images/pages/ollama_api_arquitectura.jpg" alt="Architecture" title="Ollama API Architecture" /></p>

<p>We are going to run our LLM model on a local server. We will also have the possibility to change model from a friendly administration interface, which allows us to download the model we want to use and even to test it in advance. For this reason, I have chosen <a href="https://ollama.com/">Ollama</a>, which has a very interesting opensource <a href="https://ollama.com/library">set of models</a>. We are going to see step by step how to install and configure our software.</p>

<p>But first of all, let’s see a brief description of each of the elements that we are going to install:</p>

<h2 id="ollama">Ollama</h2>

<p>Ollama makes it very easy to run open source LLM locally. You can expect decent performance even on small laptops. Ollama is an alternative to Hugging Face for running models locally. Hugging Face libraries run on top of Tensorflow or Torch. Ollama uses llama.cpp as the underlying runtime. This makes it very easy to get started with Ollama. You don’t even need to have Python installed.</p>

<h2 id="langchain">LangChain</h2>

<p>LangChain is an open source framework for building applications based on large language models (LLMs). LLMs are large deep learning models pre-trained on large amounts of data that can generate answers to user queries, for example, answering questions or creating images from text-based requests. LangChain provides tools and abstractions to improve the personalisation, accuracy and relevance of the information generated by the models. For example, developers can use LangChain components to create new request strings or customise existing templates. LangChain also includes components that allow LLMs to access new datasets without the need for retraining.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For more information, I recommend you visit the following AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/langchain/">article</a> from which this excerpt is taken.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="chromadb">ChromaDb</h2>

<p>ChromaDB is a database specialising in the efficient storage and retrieval of linguistic information, including text data, semantic and syntactic annotations. ChromaDB is particularly useful for storing and managing large amounts of natural language data, allowing developers to take full advantage of advances in machine learning algorithms and text analysis.</p>

</blockquote>

<h2 id="api-with-flask">API with Flask</h2>

<p>Flask is a Python micro web framework that provides the necessary tools to create web applications quickly and easily. Although it is a micro framework, Flask is highly modular and allows you to easily add extensions to add additional functionality.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For more information I recommend you to visit the following <a href="https://datascientest.com/es/programacion-de-api-web-en-python-con-flask">article</a> from where this snippet has been obtained and where you can follow the detailed tutorial on how to create an API with Flask.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-chatbot-web">The Chatbot web</h2>

<p>I have based myself on this integration of a web chatbot, to use the resources and adapt it to our opensource model hosted by Ollama.</p>

<p>The source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/galaxyofai/chatgpt_flask_webapp">here</a>.</p>

<p>And a detailed explanation of how to integrate it with other APIs can be found <a href="https://galaxyofai.com/building-a-flask-chat-web-app-with-openais-chatgpt-api/">here</a>.</p>

<h1 id="the-demonstration">The demonstration</h1>

<p>The application has been embedded below. It is hosted on a server with very limited characteristics for the execution of artificial intelligence developments. But as a demonstration that it is possible, here it is in operation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><img src="/images/pages/aviso_icon.png" alt="Aviso" /> <strong>The chatbot is hosted on a server with few resources</strong><br /><br />This is why it takes a long time to answer. This is precisely what we are looking for, to demonstrate the viability in this type of environment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sample questions you can ask:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What experience does Ruben Arcos have?</li>
  <li>How many years of experience does Ruben Arcos have?</li>
  <li>What programming languages does Ruben Arcos know?</li>
</ul>

<p>As usual in this website, we are going to use a dockerised environment that will be in charge of building Ollama, the Ollama web manager and our ChatBot web application.</p>

<p>For this we have the following <em>docker compose</em> scripts:</p>

<h3 id="the-installation-of-the-model-from-the-ollama-webmaster">The installation of the model from the Ollama webmaster</h3>

<p>Once we have the docker up, we just have to go to the url <a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a>, download and install the model.</p>

<p>Below is a video of how it is done:</p>

<p><img src="/images/pages/ollama_install.gif" alt="video" /></p>

<p>In our case we will introduce the model: <em>mistral:instruct</em></p>

<h3 id="the-console-application-chatbot">The console application (chatbot)</h3>

<p>Then we have the console application that consumes the LLM model, in our example we have used <em>Mistral</em> for its great performance similar to Llama and for being opensource. We also have the specification of the query promt, with some instructions prior to the queries. And the RAG training method.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
Retrieval-enhanced generation (RAG) is the process of optimising the output of a large language model so that it references an authoritative knowledge base outside of the training data sources before generating an answer. Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on large volumes of data and use billions of parameters to generate original results for tasks such as question answering, language translation and sentence completion. RAG extends the already powerful capabilities of LLMs to specific domains or to an organisation's internal knowledge base, all without the need to retrain the model. It is a cost-effective method for improving LLM results so that they remain relevant, accurate and useful in a variety of contexts.

The main purpose of the application has been to demonstrate the implementation of the knowledge acquired throughout the training on the management of user access privileges to different elements (or modules as I will refer to throughout the document) of the application, the management of hierarchical users in different groups (called roles) and the administration by an authorised user. No less relevant has been the application of knowledge in the design and management of relational databases and their implementation platforms.

Concretamente he dockerizado:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#cont-spring-boot">Spring Boot</a></li>
  <li><a href="#cont-laravel">Laravel</a></li>
  <li><a href="#cont-flask">Flask</a></li>

  <li><a href="#cont-postgres">PostgreSQL</a></li>
  <li><a href="#cont-mysql">MySQL</a></li>
  <li><a href="#cont-mongo">MongoDB</a></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="instalación-de-docker-en-el-vps">Instalación de docker en el VPS</h1>

<p><strong>Docker</strong></p>

<p>En primer lugar he tenido que instalar docker y docker compose. Para la instalación de docker en ubuntu 22.04 server :</p>

<p>Actualizamos la lista de paquetes del S.O. y actualizamos el S.O.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">apt update <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> apt upgrade</code></pre></figure>

<p>Añadimos una serie de paquetes de requisitos previos.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">apt <span class="nb">install </span>apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common</code></pre></figure>

<p>Se agrega la clave GPG para el repositorio oficial de Docker a nuestro S.O.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">curl <span class="nt">-fsSL</span> https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | apt-key add -</code></pre></figure>

<p>Y por último ya podremos añadir el repositorio a nuestro S.O. Podemos comprobar que se ha añadido una línea en /etc/apt/source.list.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">add-apt-repository <span class="s2">"deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu jammy stable"</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Actualizamos la base de datos ya que hay una línea nueva (compruebe en el listado que sale) y comprobaremos antes de instalar que vamos a instalar desde el repositorio (y no desde Ubuntu Server).</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">apt update &amp; apt-cache policy docker-ce</code></pre></figure>

<p>Por último, podremos instalar el paquete (paquete pesado de aproximadamente 400 MBytes). Como no puede ser de otra manera hay que asegurar que Docker engine está arrancado y si reinicia el servicio en el arranque del S.O. anfitrión.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">apt-get <span class="nb">install </span>docker-ce</code></pre></figure>

<p><em>Manualillo de systemctl</em></p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">systemctl disable Docker <span class="c"># deshabilitamos en el arranque el demonio docker </span>
systemctl list-unit-files | <span class="nb">grep </span>docker 
systemctl <span class="nb">enable </span>docker 
systemctl list-unit-files | <span class="nb">grep </span>docker 
systemctl stop docker <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> systemctl status Docker 
systemctl start docker <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> systemctl status Docker

<h1 id="creación-de-los-contenedores-y-docker-compose">Creación de los contenedores y docker-compose</h1>

<p>En primer lugar me he creado una carpeta <em>docker</em> en el home, que irá alojando los scripts y ficheros necesarios. Tiene la siguiente estructura:</p>

<p><img src="/images/pages/docker-jerarquia.jpg" alt="docker-jerarquia.jpg" /></p>

<p>Vamos a utilizar para el certificado de autenticación del servidor https <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let’s encrypt</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Instalación y generación del certificado Let’s encrypt</strong></p>

<p>Para la instalación de la aplicación <em>certbot</em> de Let’s encrypt para generar los certificados, recomiendo seguir las instrucciones de la siguiente página <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/instructions?ws=other&amp;os=ubuntufocal">https://certbot.eff.org/instructions?ws=other&amp;os=ubuntufocal</a> está preseleccionado para Ubuntu server.</p>

<p>La página indicada anteriormente, es la única que funciona actualmente con Ubuntu Server 22.04, el resto de tutoriales que he visitado se encuentran obsoletos al haber cambiado a snap la aplicación de certbot de Let’s encrypt y el repositorio de github ya no funciona tampoco como se esperaba en instrucciones antiguas.</p>

<p>Una vez terminado nos generará la siguiente salida:
<img src="/images/pages/certificado_letsencrypt.jpg" alt="salida_certificado_letsencrypt" /></p>

<p>Generamos el certificado que es válido para tomcat .p12.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">openssl pkcs12 <span class="nt">-export</span> <span class="nt">-in</span> /etc/letsencrypt/live/mi_dominio_web/fullchain.pem <span class="nt">-inkey</span> /etc/letsencrypt/live/mi_dominio_web/privkey.pem <span class="nt">-out</span> springboot_letsencrypt.p12 <span class="nt">-name</span> bootalias <span class="nt">-CAfile</span> chain.pem <span class="nt">-caname</span> root</code></pre></figure>

<p><em>Recuerda cambiar las rutas por las tuyas</em></p>

<p><a name="cont-spring-boot"></a></p>

<p><strong>Contenedor para Spring Boot</strong></p>

<p>Copiamos los ficheros necesarios en nuestra carpeta de nuestro nuestra carpeta en el home de <em>/docker/docker-java/</em>: estando en la raíz de esta el fichero .jar y .p12.</p>

<p><em>Generación de los scripts de docker</em></p>

<p>En primer lugar, vamos a crear un <em>Dockerfile</em> para que contenga la imagen (para Ubuntu server) y realice la copia de los ficheros necesarios (el .jar y el certificado) hacia nuestro contenedor.</p>

<p>Dockerfile</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jdk-alpine

ARG <span class="nv">JAR_FILE</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">*</span>.jar

ENTRYPOINT <span class="o">[</span><span class="s2">"java"</span>,<span class="s2">"-jar"</span>,<span class="s2">"/my_proyect_compiled.jar"</span><span class="o">]</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><em>Tendremos que cambiar el nombre del certificado y del fichero del proyecto compilado .jar</em></p>

<p>En segundo lugar, vamos a crear el script de <em>docker-compose.yml</em> que creará nuestro servicio web y expondrá el puerto 8443 por defecto.</p>

<p>docker-compose.yml</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">version: <span class="s1">'3.8'</span>
services:
  proyect_name:
    build: <span class="nb">.</span>

    restart: always
    ports:
      - <span class="s1">'8080:8080'</span>
      - <span class="s1">'8443:8443'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><em>Tendremos que cambiar el nombre del servicio y del contenedor</em></p>

<p><em>Proyecto Spring Boot</em></p>

<p>Vamos a añadir al fichero <em>aplication.properties</em> la configuración para que el servidor tomcat que crea Spring, escuche por el puerto https, que por defecto es el 8443 en lugar del 443. Y el certificado que hemos creado previamente para que nuestro servidor funcione con Let’s encrypt.</p>

<p>aplication.properties</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="n">server</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">port</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">9443</span>

<p><em>Tendremos que cambiar: el certificado, la contraseña y el alias con el que creamos anteriormente.</em></p>

<p>Generamos el fichero <em>.jar</em> mediante el comando de mvn para compilar</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">mvn package</code></pre></figure>

<p><em>Para ver la diferencia entre mvn package y mvn install, consulta este <a href="https://www.appsdeveloperblog.com/difference-between-mvn-package-and-mvn-install/">enlace</a></em></p>

<p>Ahora en la carpeta <em>/target</em> del proyecto tendremos el fichero <em>.jar</em> que pasaremos por ftp a nuestra carpeta en el home de <em>/docker/docker-java/nombre_aplicacion</em> que contendrá a su vez los ficheros de <em>Dockerfile</em> y <em>docker-compose.yml</em>, junto a nuestro certificado <em>.p12</em>. Para que todo se pueda copiar en el contenedor de docker, según las instrucciones de nuesto <em>Dockerfile</em>.</p>

<p>Finalmente, debemos tener la siguiente estructura de ficheros en la carpeta de docker:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">/docker-my_app
|-Dockerfile
|-docker-compose.yml
|-my_app.jar
|-my_cert.p12</code></pre></figure>

<p>En la página oficial del Spring Boot hay también un tutorial que indica con mayor detalle lo realizado anteriormente <a href="https://spring.io/guides/topicals/spring-boot-docker/">https://spring.io/guides/topicals/spring-boot-docker/</a> incluyendo aspectos de seguridad como la creación de un usuario diferente a root dentro del contenedor de docker.</p>

<p><a name="cont-laravel"></a></p>

<p><strong>Contenedor para Laravel</strong></p>

<p>Para Laravel vamos a utilizar un servidor ngnix con la última versión por seguridad.
para ello crearemos varios ficheros que describiré a continuación:</p>

Se trata de decidir si se compra o no en la casilla de <em>compra</em>, y predecir cual de las propiedades es mejor comprar.</p>

<h1 id="programa-generador-de-partidas">Programa generador de partidas</h1>

<p><strong>Generador de partidas</strong></p>

<p>En primer lugar he tenido que realizar una generador de partidas del juego del Hotel, para alimentar a la IA. Posteriormente he creado también un jugador IA para comparar los resultados obtenidos tras el aprendizaje de la IA.</p>

<p><em>Generador de partidas aleatorio (juego Hotel, 4 jugadores):</em></p>

<p><strong>Dataset</strong></p>

<p>El conjunto de datos utilizado es el dataset de 500 partidas, pero se ha probado progresivamente de 10, 100, 500, 1000. No teniendo apenas diferencia en el aprendizaje entre el de 500 a 1000 partidas.</p>

<p><em>10 partidas - 100 partidas - 500 partidas - 1000 partidas</em></p>

<h1 id="programa-de-ia">Programa de IA</h1>

<p>Tras alimentar con el dataset y realizar el EDA correspondiente, he procedido a probar los modelos predictivos de IA que podrían ser más recomendables debido a la casuística en la que nos encontramos. Tras descartar, los que dabamos valores totalmente fuera de lugar, han sido: Adaboost, Naives Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost y 3 modelos diferente de deep learning (LSTM, Neuronal básica, Neuronal profunda).</p>

<h2 id="creación-del-proyecto">Creación del proyecto</h2>
<p>Para la creación del proyecto primero tenemos que tener instalado composer y php. También tenerlos enlazados en el IDE para que la terminal reconozca los comandos. 
Para ver cómo enlazar php con vscode click <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/php">aquí</a>.</p>

<p>Una vez tenemos todo lo necesario, creamos el proyecto con el siguiente comando:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">composer create-project laravel/laravel nombre_app
<span class="nb">cd </span>nombre_app
php artisan serve</code></pre></figure>

<p>Y se levantará un servidor en <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000/">http://127.0.0.1:8000/</a> con el proyecto (esqueleto solamente) y la página de bienvenida.
Para más información y otros tipos de instalaciones ver <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/installation">aquí</a> en la documentación oficial.</p>

<h2 id="creación-de-los-ficheros-migration">Creación de los ficheros migration</h2>
<p>Para que laravel pueda crear la tabla en la DB, tiene unos ficheros que se encargan de crearlas, destruirlas, actualizarlas o modificarlas según vamos necesitando a lo largo del proyecto.</p>

<p>Ahora vamos a crear un fichero de migrations para la tabla <em>Property</em> que vamos a crear.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">php artisan make:migration Property</code></pre></figure>

<p>Este una vez creado lo podremos comprobar en la ruta: database\migrations\fecha_y_hora_creacion_property.php</p>

<p>Ahora vamos a completar el contenido del fichero de migración con los campos de nuestra tabla:</p>

<span class="p">};</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Como se puede comprobar tiene un método up (para la creación) y un down (para el borrado) de la tabla. Simplemente se trata de añadir el nombre de la tabla en ambos métodos, y en el up los campos de la tabla que queremos que tenga nuestro modelo.</p>

<h3 id="añadir-segunda-tabla-con-foreign-key">Añadir segunda tabla con foreign key</h3>
<p>A continuación, vamos a crear un fichero de migrations para el segundo modelo de <em>House</em> que hemos creado.</p>

<p>Este una vez creado lo podremos comprobar en la ruta: database\migrations\fecha_y_hora_creacion_house.php</p>

<span class="p">};</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Como se puede comprobar tiene una clave foránea añadida para la columna <em>property_id</em> que apunta a la tabla <em>properties</em> del campo <em>id</em>.</p>

<h2 id="creación-de-los-modelos">Creación de los modelos</h2>
<p>Laravel está compuesto por varios componentes y entre ellos tenemos un ORM llamado Eloquent, que nos va a realizar todas las gestiones de la base de datos, en nuestro caso PostgreSQL.</p>

<p>Vamos a crear un modelo que almacene nuestras viviendas (recordar que el nombre debe estar siempre en singular, ya que laravel crea las tablas en plural automáticamente) y para ellos ejecutaremos el comando:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">php artisan make:model House</code></pre></figure>

<p>Este una vez creado lo podremos comprobar en la ruta: app\Models\House.php</p>

<p>Ahora vamos a completar el contenido del modelo con los campos que dimos en nuestra tabla:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>

<span class="kn">namespace</span> <span class="nn">App\Models</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="kn">use</span> <span class="nc">Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Factories\HasFactory</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="kn">use</span> <span class="nc">Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">House</span> <span class="kd">extends</span> <span class="nc">Model</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kn">use</span> <span class="nc">HasFactory</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="k">protected</span> <span class="nv">$fillable</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span>
        <span class="s1">'shortDescription'</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="s1">'phone'</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="s1">'photo'</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="s1">'property_id'</span>
    <span class="p">];</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Haremos los mismo con el modelo <em>Property</em>:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">php artisan make:model Property</code></pre></figure>

<p>Este una vez creado lo podremos comprobar en la ruta: app\Models\Property.php</p>

<p>Ahora vamos a completar el contenido del modelo con los campos que dimos en nuestra tabla:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>

<span class="kn">namespace</span> <span class="nn">App\Models</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="kn">use</span> <span class="nc">Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Factories\HasFactory</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="k">protected</span> <span class="nv">$fillable</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span>
        <span class="s1">'name'</span><span class="p">,</span>

        <span class="s1">'phone'</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="p">];</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="realización-de-la-migración-a-la-db">Realización de la migración a la DB</h2>
<p>Primero, vamos a configurar los parámetros de conexión con nuestra DB. Estos se encuentra en el fichero de configuración <em>.env</em> en la raíz del proyecto. Concretamente cambiaremos la parte referente a la DB:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nv">DB_CONNECTION</span><span class="o">=</span>pgsql
<span class="nv">DB_HOST</span><span class="o">=</span>127.0.0.1
<span class="nv">DB_PORT</span><span class="o">=</span>5432
<span class="nv">DB_DATABASE</span><span class="o">=</span>laravel
<span class="nv">DB_USERNAME</span><span class="o">=</span>postgres
<span class="nv">DB_PASSWORD</span><span class="o">=</span>postgres</code></pre></figure>

<p>Posteriormente, migramos todos los cambios a la DB con el comando:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">php artisan make:migration</code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="creación-del-controlador">Creación del controlador</h2>
<p>Ahora vamos a crear un controlador para cada modelo, estos tendrán las operaciones básicas de un CRUD que es lo que vamos a necesitar.</p>

<p>Para crear el controlador del modelo <em>House</em> ejecutamos:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">php artisan make:controller HouseController</code></pre></figure>

<p>Y el contenido del controlador sería el siguiente:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-php" data-lang="php"><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>

<h2 id="sistema-de-vistas">Sistema de vistas</h2>
<p>Debido a que es un sistema completo las vistas que se han realizado, añadiendo bootstrap y demás elementos web, que directamente te bajes los recursos de mi repositorio y le eches un vistazo al funcionamiente, puesto que es intuitivo.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rubenarcos2/laravel-Inmobiliaria/tree/main/resources/views">https://github.com/rubenarcos2/laravel-Inmobiliaria/tree/main/resources/views</a></p>

<h2 id="instalación-módulo-auth-login">Instalación módulo Auth: login</h2>
<p>Tendremos que ejeuctar los siguientes comandos:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">composer require laravel/ui
php artisan ui vue <span class="nt">--auth</span>
npm <span class="nb">install
</span>npm run dev</code></pre></figure>

<p>Comprobaremos que nos ha creado:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Actualizado el controlador HomeController en App\Http\Controllers</li>
  <li>Creado una carpeta <em>auth</em> en la vista en resources\views\auth</li>
  <li>Añadido <em>Auth::routes();</em> a nuestros endpoints en routes\web.php</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="solución-al-error-de-la-pérdida-del-estilo-en-login-logout-y-forgot-módulo-auth">Solución al error de la pérdida del estilo en login, logout y forgot. Módulo ‘auth’.</h2>
<p>Aún instalado todo lo anterior, se puede dar el caso de que se pierda el estilo de las páginas de auth que se acaban de instalar, para solucionarlo:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ir a la vista \resources\views\layouts\app.blade.php</li>
  <li>Eliminar las rutas al css y el fichero jss</li>
  <li>Sustituirlas por:</li>
</ul>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;<span class="nb">link </span><span class="nv">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.1/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"</span> <span class="nv">rel</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"stylesheet"</span> <span class="nv">integrity</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"sha384-F3w7mX95PdgyTmZZMECAngseQB83DfGTowi0iMjiWaeVhAn4FJkqJByhZMI3AhiU"</span> <span class="nv">crossorigin</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"anonymous"</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>

<p>Y una vez guardado se verán los cambios ya aplicados y nuestra aplicación ya tendrá servicio de autenticación completo. Solo tendremos que ir añadiendo la autenticación requerida en los endpoints.</p>

<h2 id="modificación-del-enrutador">Modificación del enrutador</h2>
<p>Ahora vamos a modificar el enrutador para que tenga los endpoints restringidos y solamente se pueda acceder a la vista principal sin haber hecho <em>login in</em>.</p>
